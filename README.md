# Plain PHP REST/RESTful API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading
A Comprehensive Plain PHP & MySQL REST/RESTful API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading feature. The API is built following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern, and is totally Object-oriented (OOP).

The idea is an API for creating personal To-Do Lists (Tasks) and their associated Images. You can create a To-Do List and assign an image to each task.

This project script is written entirely in plain PHP (OOP) and aims to showcase the implementation of an API with Token-based Authentication without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Features:
1- MVC Design Pattern.

2- Advanced use of the ***.htaccess*** "per-directory" Apache configuration file for routing control and URL redirection (URL Rewriting using the RewriteEngine). Check the API's ***[.htaccess file](v1/.htaccess)***.

3- Token-based Authentication using a short-lived "Access Token" (20 minutes) and a longer-term "Refresh Token" (2 weeks).

4- Totally Object-oriented design.

5- Protected Routes.

6- HTTP Responses with Pagination.

7- Advanced Error Handling involving custom Exception classes which return appropriate JSON format error messages with the right HTTP Status Codes.

8- Advanced SQL INNER JOIN clauses and CRUD operations.

9- File Upload and File Download API Endpoints.

10- Registration, Validation, Authentication, and Authorization.

***\*\* Note: You can test the API Endpoints using Postman. Here is the API's Postman Collection .json file [Postman Collection file](<Postman Collection of API Endpoints/Plain PHP REST API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading.postman_collection.json>) you can download and import in your Postman.***

## Installation & Configuration:
1- Clone the project or download it.

2- Create a MySQL database named **\`tasksdb\`** and import the database SQL Dump file **[tasksdb Database SQL Dump File](<Database - tasksdb/tasksdb database - SQL Dump File - PhpMyAdmin Export.sql>)**.

3- Navigate to the Database Connection Class file **[db.php](v1/controller/db.php)** and configure/edit/update it with your MySQL database credentials and other configuration settings.

4- Important Note: "**`Apache`**" Web Server must be used for serving this API in order for the ***.htaccess*** file to work, as I based all of the routing system work and URL redirection/URL Rewriting on the ***.htaccess*** file (RewriteEngine and RewriteRule-s). Check the API's ***[.htaccess file](v1/.htaccess)***. Start by typing in the API Endpoint: **`POST http://127.0.0.1/v1/users`** in your Postman to Sign up.

- Credentials of a ready-to-use registered user account are: (Use this account to Log in and create a new session i.e. get a new "Access Token" and "Refresh Token" with the following Endpoint: **`POST http://127.0.0.1/v1/sessions`**)

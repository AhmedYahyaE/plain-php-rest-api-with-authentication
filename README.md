# Plain PHP REST/RESTful API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading
A comprehensive Plain PHP & MySQL REST/RESTful API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading feature. Totally Object-oriented design (OOP). The idea is an API for Tasks or To-Do Lists and their associated images. This project script is written entirely in plain PHP (OOP) and aims to demonstrate the implementation of an API with a Token-based Authentication without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

***\*\* Note: You can test the API Endpoints using Postman. Here is the Postman Collection .json file [Postman Collection](<Postman Collection of API Endpoints/Plain PHP REST API with Token-based Authentication and Image Uploading.postman_collection.json>) you can download and import in your Postman.***

## Installation & Configuration:
1- Clone the project or download it.

2- Create a MySQL database named **\`my_plain_php_mvc_oop_framework\`** and import the database SQL Dump file [Database SQL Dump file](<Database - my_plain_php_mvc_oop_framework/my_plain_php_mvc_oop_framework database - SQL Dump File - PhpMyAdmin Export.sql>).

3- Navigate to the ***.env*** file **[.env](.env)** and configure/edit/update it with your MySQL database credentials and other configuration settings.

4- Navigate to the project "public" folder/directory (where the Entry Point [index.php](public/index.php) file is placed) using the **`cd`** terminal command, and then start your PHP built-in Development Web Server by running the command: **`php -S localhost:8000`**.

***\*\*Note: Whatever your Web Server is, you must configure its Web Root Directory to be the application "public" folder which contains the [index.php](public/index.php) file (Entry Point) in order for the Routing System to function properly.***

5- In your browser, go to http://localhost:8000/.
